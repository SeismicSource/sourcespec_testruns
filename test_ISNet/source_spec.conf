# Notes:
# 1. SourceSpec will not enter in subdirectories of the given directory
#    (only one level allowed)
# 2. Traceid for PAZ files is specified through their name.
#    The traceid (network.station.location.channel) must be in the last four
#    fields (separated by a dot ".") before the file suffix (which can be

# 3. If no traceid is specified through the PAZ file name, then it is assumed
#    that this is a generic PAZ, valid for all the stations that do not have
#    a specific PAZ. Use "trace_units" below to specify the units of the
